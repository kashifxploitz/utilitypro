        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 16, 2025</p>
        <p>Welcome to UtilityPro ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our website, accessible at <a href="https://kashifxploitz.github.io/utilitypro/">https://kashifxploitz.github.io/utilitypro/</a> ("Website"). UtilityPro provides client-side tools such as calculators, unit converters, and password generators. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about our practices.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>Our Website operates primarily as a client-side application, meaning most functionalities (e.g., calculations, conversions, password generation) are performed locally on your device. As such, we do not collect, store, or process personal information unless explicitly stated. Specifically:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Personal Data Collection:</strong> We do not require user accounts, logins, or personal information (e.g., name, email, or address) to use our tools.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We do not collect usage data, analytics, or tracking information directly. However, our Website is hosted on GitHub Pages, which may log visitor IP addresses for security purposes, as noted in GitHub’s documentation. This data is managed by GitHub and not accessible to us. For details, see <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#data-collection">GitHub’s Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>User-Provided Data:</strong> Any data you input into our tools (e.g., numbers for calculations or text for conversions) is processed locally on your device and is not transmitted to or stored by us.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect personal information, we do not use or share such data. The tools provided on the Website function entirely on your device, ensuring that your inputs remain private and are not sent to any external servers.</p>

        <h2>3. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
        <p>Our Website does not use cookies, web beacons, or other tracking technologies. As a static site hosted on GitHub Pages, no session data or tracking mechanisms are implemented by us.</p>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The Website is hosted on GitHub Pages, a service provided by GitHub, Inc. GitHub may collect certain technical data, such as IP addresses, for security and operational purposes, as outlined in their <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement">Privacy Statement</a>. We do not control or access this data. No other third-party services or integrations that collect user data are used on our Website.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We prioritize your privacy by designing our Website to minimize data collection. Since all processing occurs on your device, there is no risk of data breaches from our servers. The Website is served over HTTPS, ensuring encrypted communication between your browser and GitHub Pages’ servers, as per GitHub’s standard practices.</p>

        <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>As we do not collect or store personal information, there is no personal data for you to access, correct, or delete. If you have concerns about data collected by GitHub Pages, please refer to GitHub’s Privacy Statement or contact GitHub directly.</p>

        <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our Website is not directed to individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information, please contact us, though note that our tools do not collect such data.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. We will post the updated policy on this page with a revised "Effective Date." We encourage you to review this page periodically.</p>

        <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our practices, please contact us at:</p>

        <p>Please note that we are unable to respond to requests regarding data we do not collect or control, such as data managed by GitHub.</p>
